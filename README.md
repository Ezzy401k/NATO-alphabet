# NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter

This Python program takes a word input from the user and converts it into its corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet code.

## How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a word.
2. The input word is converted to uppercase.
3. Each letter of the input word is stored in a list.
4. The NATO phonetic alphabet data is read from a CSV file into a DataFrame.
5. A dictionary is created to map each letter to its corresponding phonetic code.
6. The program generates a list of phonetic codes for each letter in the input word.
7. The list of phonetic codes is printed.

## Features

- User input for entering a word.
- Conversion of the word into uppercase.
- Mapping of each letter to its NATO phonetic code.
- Generation of a list of phonetic codes for the input word.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Pandas library

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Install the pandas library using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

3. Clone the repository:

```bash
